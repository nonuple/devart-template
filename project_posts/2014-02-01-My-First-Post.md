Hello World. We are [Cheng Guo](http://www.chengguo.co.uk "Cheng Guo") and Yiyun Chen From Shanghai CASP Lab(Tongji University). I(Cheng Guo) previously graduated from Design Products, Royal College of Art(RCA),London, UK, and Yiyun is come from Design Interactions(RCA). We are now working at the CASP Lab of Sino-finnish centre,Tongji University, Shanghai, China. CASP is short of Critical Art and Science Practice, CASP aims to integrate resources inside and outside the university to form a research and innovation centre for artist, designer and scientist and become a catalyst for innovation and creative industries. We organized workshops and forums as well as generating projects that combine art and science in various fields.

We got to know the DevArt competition through the promoting lecture host by GDG Shanghai early this week and decided to join it almost immediacy.  Itâ€™s truly a challenge to us since the late attendance and there is only three weeks left, and we think we have a strong idea and have the ability to achieve it. Let see : )
