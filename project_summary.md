## Description
Different from traditional password-access WiFi, “We Provide Free WiFi” is a series of routers that provide WiFi access activated by users' specific actions. As one of the main symbols of and entrance to the online world,  WiFi is now too commonplace to be noticed. To put it in another way, seeking for WiFi access in public or unfamiliar space has become people's instinct, regardless that the security of these kinds of WiFi access has been heavily criticized. “We Provide Free WiFi”, as a series of encrypted WiFi providers (routers), provide WiFi connection only if users yell out loud to a certain decibel or climb to a certain height. In this process, these self-exposed and insecure behaviors become password itself. While the digital and abstractive passwords become open behaviors, questions popped out: Do we really need WiFi anytime and anywhere? And how much effort do we want to pay for  WiFi access?
